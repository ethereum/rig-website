## Abstract

This EIP proposes a uniform price auction over inclusion lists (UPIL), which ranks transactions by their offered ranking fee per gas. When the block is full, no transaction is allowed to displace an inclusion-list (IL) transaction that passes regular inclusion criteria and offers a higher ranking fee per gas. All included transactions pay a uniform inclusion price, equal to the highest ranking fee offered by any valid IL transaction excluded from the block, and this fee is burned. UPIL achieves strong censorship resistance by not allowing builders to circumvent propagated ILs when the block is full. This is particularly valuable for time-sensitive transactions and promotes fairness while preventing cheap block-stuffing under a multidimensional fee market. UPIL is specified to run on top of FOCIL (EIP-7805), but can be deployed on top of any IL mechanism.
